 Define the Project Structure & Requirements
API Endpoints:

User Endpoints: Accept transaction data submissions, send back responses (e.g., confirmation or immediate feedback on suspicious transactions).

Admin Endpoints: Provide fraud transaction data, filtering options, and summary analytics.

Database Design:

Define collections or tables to store user transactions, fraud analysis results, and logs.

Integration Points:

API endpoint for calling the AI microservice (whether it’s a separate Python service or an integrated module) to perform fraud analysis.

Security & Error Handling:

Incorporate user authentication for admin endpoints and basic error handling on API requests.

2. Choose Your Backend Tech Stack
Since your team handles AI and frontend, you can choose either:

Node.js (Express.js):

Great for handling real-time API requests and easy integration with the frontend (especially if it’s also JavaScript-based).

Python (FastAPI/Flask):

If you prefer staying in Python for a more cohesive development environment with the AI team.

FastAPI is particularly good for asynchronous requests and automatic API docs.

Tip:
You can also consider a hybrid approach where your main API is built in Node.js, and you call out to a Python-based AI service via REST APIs.

3. Outline the API Endpoints & Data Flow
User Transaction API
Endpoint: POST /api/transaction

Function:

Receive transaction details.

Validate data and store it in the database.

Optionally, immediately call the AI service for fraud analysis and update the record.

Admin Fraud Data API
Endpoint: GET /api/fraud-transactions

Function:

Retrieve all transactions flagged as fraud.

Include filtering (e.g., by date, risk score) and pagination.

Internal AI Integration API
Endpoint: (Internal use, e.g., POST /api/analyze-transaction)

Function:

Forward transaction data to the AI service.

Receive fraud score and fraud flag.

Update the transaction record accordingly.

4. Start With a Simple MVP
Project Setup:

Set up your project repository and environment.

Install dependencies (e.g., Express.js for Node or FastAPI for Python).

Database Schema:

Define a simple schema for transactions (e.g., transaction ID, user ID, amount, merchant, location, timestamp, is_fraud, fraud_score).

Build Core Endpoints:

Create a basic API endpoint for accepting transactions.

Create a dummy endpoint for the admin panel that queries the database for transactions marked as fraud.

Integrate AI Call:

Stub out an API call (using fetch or similar) to your AI microservice. Initially, you can simulate a response with dummy data.

Testing & Documentation:

Write simple tests for your API endpoints.

Document the API endpoints (using Swagger/OpenAPI if possible).
